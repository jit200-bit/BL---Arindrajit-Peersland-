Today, I studied and implemented the fundamentals of Git and GitHub. I understood how Git Bash works and how to connect Git with VS Code for development. I gained hands-on experience by implementing a complete GitFlow workflow, which included configuring Git locally, cloning a repository, initializing GitFlow, and working with core branching concepts such as main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches. I also practiced creating commits, merging changes, and understood the purpose of tags and tag messages for proper versioning. Initially, I faced some confusion with Git’s default editor (Vim) during merge and tag message prompts, but I resolved it and now understand how to handle these situations correctly. Tomorrow, I plan to study Java basic concepts and complete 2–3 Java learning videos.

In addition to this, I completed two Durga Java tutorial videos, which helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals. I will continue learning more advanced Java concepts in the coming days.
